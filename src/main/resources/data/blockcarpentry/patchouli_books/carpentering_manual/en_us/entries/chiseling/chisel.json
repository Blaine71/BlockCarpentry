Not every block has different designs, though. For those who have some, you can cycle through the different available designs by right-clicking the frame or illusion block with the chisel."

Chiseling is possible for doors, trapdoors, ladders, fences, fence gates, walls, beds, chests, carpets, panes and daylight detectors."
